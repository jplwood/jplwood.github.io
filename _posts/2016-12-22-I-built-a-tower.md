This evening after work I was walking home listening to a podcast where one panelist used a great metaphor for distinguishing between new and experienced developers: building a tower.

<!--more-->

He said that regardless of how great of a programmer you are, newer developers tend to build towers. That tower could be absolutely immaculate but the question is, would it fit in a city. Could you build that same tower and have it integrate into a massive city. 

Well, while walking along, I started thinking about a new feature I made for a web app at work. I built Tower. Whoops.

I recently started reading Joel Spolsky's blog, [_Joel on Software_](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/), and one of the first posts I read was [_Things You Should Never Do, Part I_](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/). In this post, Joel says something very simple, but very powerful:

> It’s harder to read code than to write it.

Yeap. So true. When I started my job at the [IPM Institute](https://ipminstitute.org), I came in plenty of (over)confidence in my abilities. I looked at the code base for the [Pesticide Risk Tool](https://pesticiderisk.org/) (PRT) and wanted to tear it down and rebuild it. _For sure, I can write this better than former-programmer-no-longer-with-the-organization_, he thought, naively. Let's rewrite this bad boy. 

That was two years ago. I still have those feelings from time to time, but I've come to realize that this thinking is super naive. _Most of the time_, you shouldn't scrap all of what you have and rewrite it. Read that Joel Spolsky article above.

So listening to this podcast, I realized that one major feature I contributed to the PRT is a tower. It's a huge, beautiful, powerful, non-integrated tower. I love it, but now I'm realizing this to be quite a weakness. I suppose this is a good thing though. Getting better. Onward and upward. 

Okay. Let's see if we can move this massive tower into the city, the big, messy city that is a huge web app.
