Time, for someone who until recently didn't have much, is most excellent most of the time. Until you find yourself wallowing in self-pity under a blanket on a Tuesday afternoon -- trying to figure out what the hell you want to do with your life.


Having had nothing but time on my hands, I realized the ups and downs are just part of the deal. As crazy, or not crazy, it may seem, I asked for this. Sometimes, if you need to make a change, you just have to do it without a plan. I took a leap of faith, moved to Madison without a job in order to feel uncomfortable and force myself out of complacency.


Working at Wonderlic was an incredible experience and I truly could see myself remaining engulfed in my work there for years to come. I met some lifetime friends and was given incredible opportunities. I got to go to the NFL Combine in Indianapolis to administer the Wonderlic Personnel Test to hundreds of huge dudes. That's crazy. I was incredibly comfortable, but deep down, I felt as though my life was on hold. I didn't know what I wanted to do, but assumed that would answer itself. Well, it never did, and it still hasn't. I left so I might have more time explore my interests, teach myself some new stuff (i.e., this [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) blog) and hopefully find a good career path to head down.


In the meantime, I've gotten to play some ultimate frisbee, go to a few [bluegrass jams](http://swbmai.org/Drupal/), cook (poorly) some short ribs and XC-ski across Lake Mendota. Nora and I have explored some of the best restaurants in Madison and spent too much money on fresh roasted coffee and organic foodstuffs. It is extremely hard to believe that I've already been here for a month. It seems that no matter the conditions, time flies. Who knows if it's possible to slow it down.


With that in mind,  As I sit and look out my window, I hope to spend more time reflecting on the ways I use my time, consider new ideas I come across and share any advice I get.
