I thought this drink <br> would taste a bit more like cider


But who am I to complain <br> about gluttonous freebies.


Earlier I considered the extent <br> of words in all of the books in existence:


Overwhelmed that such depth and <br> care had been taken to fill innumerable pages


that I will likely never read. <br> But then again, who really knows?


When I'm old and my eyebrows are <br> monstrous and silver, I may finally pick up


That long(,) irrelevant novel and <br> suck the literary sap though thick glasses.


It would make me feel still and <br> old, gnarled and outstretched,


like the far reaching angel wings <br> of an oak tree in south carolina that,


unfortunately, did not foresee human <br> development encroaching on its roots


as a little acorn, quietly dropping <br> into the dirt 400 years before.


Why the acorn did not know this, <br> I cannot say -- well, maybe I can say.


Probably because its a tree, stupid. <br> Trees become canoes, they do not make them.


Now its eight o'clock and I'm <br> being chased out the doors by a broom,


of the verbal sort. Swept into the street <br> that's smelling of burgers and beer.
